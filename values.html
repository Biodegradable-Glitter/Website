        The protagonists, Miles Morals and Princes Mononoke aim to save their mentors.
        By utilising the socio-cultural priorities of New York and Japan, they highlight the importance of cultural values.
        Miles Morales is an adventurous teenager who follows the traditional values of society of respect to Spider-Man.
        Alternatively, Princes Mononoke is more controlled and holds more spiritual values of Shintoism, indicating the differences within the two movies.

        In Spider-Man into the Spider Verse, the Leap of faith scene indicates the need for teenager to have faith in themselves.
        The use of upside down screen indicates he is rising towards a goal, like many people in life.
        The character appearance also contributes greatly to the ideation of Spider-Man into the Spider Verse.
        Furthermore, the use of contrast in the border of Miles to the outline of the city highlights his less-developed stage.
        Upon leaping, he appears to stand out from the city, indicating his growth into a braver hero.
        In Spider-Man, he is portrayed as a dark-skinned boy, contrasting to the original white-skinned Peter Parker.
        His ability to achieve goals in scenes like the leap of faith demonstrate that anyone can do anything as long as they believe in themselves.
        Furthermore, the scenes nearing the end where Miles gathers the courage to fight alongside the other Spider people indicates his bravery and willingness to save everyone, conforming to the expected action of the traditional Spider-Man.
        Overall, Spider-Man into the Spider Verse focuses highly on the pressures and ideals of heroes from comics, thus indicating that no one is perfect and everyone has their own struggles.

        Princess Mononoke focuses greatly on the adventure of a young prince who is seen as a town hero as he seeks for a cure to heal himself and more importantly, save his town from evil by being exiled.
        The use of Japanese spiritual values demonstrates the importance of Shintoism to the Japanese.
        The Tree Spirit is an example.
        The Tree Spirit brought life to flora and fauna but then let them die to demonstrate the belief that things live and then die.
        Near the end of the movie, Ashitaka and Princess Mononoke who have both been influenced by the evil forces were healed and revived by the Forest Spirit who also restored everything else.
        This indicates the importance of bringing life.
        Furthermore, the scene near the beginning where Ashitaka fights the evil boar demonstrates the wicked influence of immorality on people and highlights the importance of Shintoism to the Japanese.
        With the boar being dead, it serves as a warning to Ashitaka to leave his town and save everyone else who may be influenced by this wickedness, thus demonstrating the value of Shintoism in the movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spider-Man into the Spider Verse and Princess Mononoke vary greatly in ideation but both demonstrate the aim to save close relations.
        In the instance of Spider-Man, he is trying to save the whole of New York City from the Big Guy while in Princess Mononoke, his hometown, Iron Town and San.
        Through both heroes’ journeys, they ultimately demonstrate values of the common teenager and Shintoism respectively.
        These prioritise the importance of courage and the process of life and death, highlighting that difference cultures hold different values.
        Ultimately, both films portray the importance of being a hero and saving your close ones.
        “It's knowing what needs to be done that brings strength.
        And courage.
        No matter how buried it gets, or lost you feel, you must promise me, that you will hold on to hope and keep it alive.”
